Output 1:


🎯 Object Detection System is a deep learning project that detects and classifies objects in images/videos using CNN-based models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN. Built with TensorFlow/PyTorch and OpenCV, it supports real-time detection, bounding boxes, and can be customized for various domains such as traffic, healthcare, and retail.



# 🎯 Object Detection System using Deep Learning
# 📖 Overview
The Object Detection System is a deep learning project that identifies and localizes objects within images or video streams.
It leverages state-of-the-art CNN architectures such as YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN to perform real-time detection with bounding boxes and labels.

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to computer vision tasks like traffic monitoring, surveillance, healthcare imaging, and retail analytics.
